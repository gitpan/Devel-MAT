NAME
    `Devel::MAT::Dumper' - write a heap dump file for later analysis

SYNOPSIS
     use Devel::MAT::Dumper;

     Devel::MAT::Dumper::dump( "path/to/the/file.pmat" );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides the memory-dumping function that creates a heap
    dump file which can later be read by Devel::MAT::Dumpfile. It provides a
    single function which is not exported, which writes a file to the given
    path.

    The dump file will contain a representation of every SV in Perl's arena,
    providing information about pointers between them, as well as other
    information about the state of the process at the time it was created.
    It contains a snapshot of the process at that moment in time, which can
    later be loaded and analysed by various tools using
    `Devel::MAT::Dumpfile'.

IMPORT OPTIONS
    The following `import' options control the behaviour of the module. They
    may primarily be useful when used in the `-M' perl option:

  -dump_at_END
    Installs an `END' block which writes a dump file at `END' time, just
    before the interpreter exits.

     $ perl -MDevel::MAT::Dumper=-dump_at_END ...

  -dump_at_SIGQUIT
    Installs a handler for `SIGQUIT' to write a dump file if the signal is
    received.

     $ perl -MDevel::MAT::Dumper=-dump_at_SIGQUIT ...

  -file $PATH
    Sets the name of the file which is automatically dumped; defaults to
    $0.pmat if not supplied.

     $ perl -MDevel::MAT::Dumper=-file,foo.pmat ...
