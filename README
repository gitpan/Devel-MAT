NAME
    `Devel::MAT' - analyse perl memory usage

DESCRIPTION
    A `Devel::MAT' instance loads a heapdump file, and provides a container
    to store analysis tools to work on it. Tools may be provided that
    conform to the Devel::MAT::Tool API, which can help analyse the data and
    interact with the explorer user interface by using the methods in the
    Devel::MAT::UI package.

CONSTRUCTOR
  $pmat = Devel::MAT->load( $path, %args )
    Loads a heap dump file from the given path, and returns a new
    `Devel::MAT' instance wrapping it.

METHODS
  $df = $pmat->dumpfile
    Returns the underlying Devel::MAT::Dumpfile instance backing this
    analysis object.

  @tools = $pmat->available_tools
    Lists the Devel::MAT::Tool classes that are installed and available.

  $tool = $pmat->load_tool( $name )
    Loads the named Devel::MAT::Tool class.
