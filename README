NAME
    `Devel::MAT::Dumper' - write a heap dump file for later analysis

SYNOPSIS
     use Devel::MAT::Dumper;

     Devel::MAT::Dumper::dump( "path/to/the/file.pmat" );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides the memory-dumping function that creates a heap
    dump file which can later be read by Devel::MAT::Dumpfile. It provides a
    single function which is not exported, which writes a file to the given
    path.

    The dump file will contain a representation of every SV in Perl's arena,
    providing information about pointers between them, as well as other
    information about the state of the process at the time it was created.
    It contains a snapshot of the process at that moment in time, which can
    later be loaded and analysed by various tools using
    `Devel::MAT::Dumpfile'.
