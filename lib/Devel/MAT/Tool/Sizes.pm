=head1 NAME

C<Devel::MAT::Tool::Sizes> - calculate sizes of SV structures

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This C<Devel::MAT> tool calculates the sizes of the structures around SVs.
The individual size of each individual SV is given by the C<size> method,
though in several cases SVs can be considered to be part of larger structures
of a combined aggregate size. This tool calculates those sizes and adds them
to the UI.

The structural size is calculated from the basic size of the SV, added to
which for various types is:

=over 2

=item ARRAY

Arrays add the basic size of every non-mortal element SV.

=item HASH

Hashes add the basic size of every non-mortal value SV.

=item CODE

Codes add the basic size of their padlist and constant value, and all their
padnames, pads, constants and globrefs.

=back

The owned size is calculated by starting at the given SV and accumulating the
set of every strong outref whose refcount is 1. This is the set of all SVs the
original directly owns.

   );

=head1 SV METHODS

This tool adds the following SV methods.

=head2 @svs = $sv->structure_set

Returns the total set of the SV's structure.

=head2 $size = $sv->structure_size

Returns the size, in bytes, of the structure that the SV contains.

# ARRAY structure includes the element SVs

{
   my $av = shift;
   my @svs = ( $av, grep { $_ && !$_->immortal } $av->elems );

# HASH structure includes the value SVs

{
   my $hv = shift;

sub Devel::MAT::SV::structure_size
{
   return sum0 map { $_->size } shift->structure_set
}

=head2 @svs = $sv->owned_set

Returns the set of every SV owned by the given one.

=head2 $size = $sv->owned_size

Returns the total size, in bytes, of the SVs owned by the given one.
